# AkitaActive

This is a simple demonstration of using [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita/) with Angular that I created to experiment with Akita and its Active EntityStore. It is designed to be a simple list of users (there is no way as of now to add a new entry, but my other repo [Akita-Todo](https://github.com/TimTCrouch/akita-todo) includes adding new entries and was created when I was learning how to use the base EntityStore). I make no claim that everything is perfect in this as I am just learning Akita, but it does work.
